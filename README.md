# Calculator App

A simple calculator application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This calculator carries out the following operations: +, -, *, / and % (which is both, percentage, and modulus). The calculator also has a 'history' list which views your latest operations. Clicking on a history item will put it back in display, and you can edit the values, so that if you make a mistake, you dont have to start everything over!
This app works using mouse, keyboard, touch screens and is screen reader friendly!
